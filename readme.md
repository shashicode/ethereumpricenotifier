# Ethereum pricing console app for CEX.io

Built to notify when Ethereum crosses certain Price, as I work a lot in console so built this to notify me Ethereum pricing on console.

You can set two variables as of now
  - refreshDuration - Sets the millisecond duration for Ethereum pricing refresh (app.js).
  - beepWhenAboveAmount - Set the amount when Ethereum price crosses the given price and console starts to beep with system sound (app.js).

# Initial setup

  - Clone the app.
  - Switch to directory where the app is cloned.
  - Run "npm install".
  - Set the desired variable in app.js.
  - run "nodemon app.js"
